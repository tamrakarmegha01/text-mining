Text analysis is a machine learning technique that allows companies to automatically extract and classify text data, such as tweets, emails, support tickets, product reviews, and survey responses. Businesses might want to extract specific information, like keywords, names, or company information from a bunch of emails, or categorize survey responses by sentiment and topic. Either way, manually organizing huge amounts of text data no longer scales. Just imagine if Walmart's employees had to manually process the one-million customer transactions they receive every day.
